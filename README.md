## Project Goal

This is my fifth portfolio project for Code Institute, and I hope to demonstrate the abilities I've acquired by doing so. Due to my dream of establishing such an online business, I then decided to use this opportunity to build this for the future.

## UX

As a graphic designer myI intended to make the website quite simple while I was developing it. When trying to convince a user to become a customer, overcomplicating the aesthetic of an online business runs the danger of creating a poor user experience.
It is a business-to-consumer e-commerce site that tends to supply customers with the best quality customised T-shirts with a lot of messages in the christian faith and also be a piece to guide a man in life because of the words in some of the designs.
On visiting the site, user's are greeted with a large image that gives a cleatr introduction of all what the site is about.
All users will be able to browse/sort Products, add to a cart, and checkout. Registered users will be able to add products to their Wishlist, view their Order history, and update/save their delivery information for quicker checkouts. Registered users will also be able to review products and like/comment on Blog posts. Staff will be able to add/edit/delete Products and add/edit/delete Blog Posts without entering admin. Any user reviews can be edited/deleted by Staff if required. When dealing with Products Staff will be able to make a Product a featured Product to be displayed on the Homepage or put a Product on sale. The graphical elements and overall design of the site provide the user with an enjoyable experience with an aesthetically pleasing display.
